SLIDE 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1:30)
================================================================================
Show: 1_executive_summary.png

SAY:
'AI validation is expensive and manual. We've developed an RL-based
system that automates testing and learns optimal strategies.

Our results show significant improvements:
- Enhanced DQN finds 55% more bugs than random testing
- Multi-agent system achieves highest efficiency
- Better coverage-efficiency balance than all baselines'

================================================================================
SLIDE 2: ARCHITECTURE (2:00)
================================================================================
Show: 2_architecture.png

SAY:
'Our system has 5 layers:
1. Multi-agent coordination with specialist agents
2. RL agents using DQN and UCB algorithms
3. Custom tools: adversarial generator, mutation engine, coverage analyzer
4. Validation environment with progressive difficulty and fallbacks
5. Target system with intentional vulnerabilities'

================================================================================
SLIDE 3: PERFORMANCE COMPARISON (2:00)
================================================================================
Show: 3_performance_comparison.png

SAY:
'Enhanced methods outperform all baselines across multiple metrics.
The scatter plot shows the coverage-efficiency trade-off.
RL methods achieve better balance than coverage-guided testing'

================================================================================
SLIDE 4: LEARNING CURVES (1:30)
================================================================================
Show: 4_learning_curves.png

SAY:
'These curves demonstrate clear learning progression.
Rewards increase, bugs found grow, coverage expands.
Progressive difficulty prevents premature convergence'

================================================================================
SLIDE 5: CUSTOM TOOLS (1:30)
================================================================================
Show: 5_custom_tools.png

SAY:
'Three custom tools significantly enhance capabilities:
- Adversarial generator uses gradients to find edge cases
- Mutation engine evolves successful tests
- Coverage analyzer identifies blind spots
Together they provide 56% improvement over baseline'

================================================================================
SLIDE 6: MULTI-AGENT COLLABORATION (1:30)
================================================================================
Show: 6_multi_agent.png

SAY:
'Specialist agents collaborate through knowledge sharing.
Each focuses on their domain: security, correctness, coverage.
Team performance exceeds individual agents by 40%'

================================================================================
CLOSING: IMPACT & ETHICS (1:00)
================================================================================
Show: 8_key_insights.png

SAY:
'This work advances AI safety through:
- Automated, efficient validation testing
- Novel multi-agent collaboration
- Production-ready architecture

We've addressed ethical concerns:
- Dual-use mitigation through defensive focus
- Transparency in decision-making
- Open-source for broad access'
